# RadarrCollection
This script is designed to add, update and repair broken media in Radarr's Library

# Goal
My original intentions wwas to write a script I coudl run regularly to add movie series collections into Radarr, since it can't see deeper than the root movie folder where my movie series are a subfolder of the root movies in folders called "<Movie Series Name> Collection" and "<Movie Series Name> Anthology". These folders were auto created when I ran TinyMediaManger (https://www.tinymediamanager.org/) on my movies collections...I sson foudn out this broke Radarr's invnetory and had to remvoe over 100+ movies. It was a pain. I then decided to wrtie this script to add them back but in the proper folder.
